"Global warming is the latest alarm bell for earth’s environment. Global warming refers to the increase in average temperature of earth’s surface during the last century, from 1900-2000. Earth’s surface’s temperature has increased more than one degree Fahrenheit since 1900. Global warming is alarming because of its adverse effects on the ecological balance of earth. The resultant ecological imbalance, due to global warming, is the root cause of various natural calamities like floods, famines, etc. Also it is the root cause of various environmental threats like increase in sea level, glacier melting, changes in quantity and pattern of rainfall, heat waves, extreme seasons, etc. This is why global warming is the buzzword of almost all environmental talks, projects and discussions, etc. Global warming is a threat to the very existence of life on earth. Not only human, but any other form of life, be it flora or fauna face a threat in the face of global warming. Hence, it has became the pungent need of the hour to root out the causes of this threating phenomenon. The most evident causes of global warming are industrialization, urbanization, deforestation, sophisticated human lifestyle and related human activities. These human activities and trends have led to increased emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. These gases in turn has led to an increase in average temperature of earth’s surface, hence global warming history. Greenhouse effect is a natural process wherein sunlight passes through atmosphere, warming earth’s surface. Then, the earth’s surface and water bodies release energy in form of heat or infrared radiations into atmosphere and maintains balance with the incoming energy. Greenhouse gases can absorb some of the infrared radiation. But increase in greenhouse gases has led to more absorption of infrared radiation which in turn has led to the increase of earth’s surface temperature. There is no doubt that the ever increasing phenomenon of global warming would lead to a total extinction of any form of life from earth’s face. Global warming deplets the ozone layer and might lead us to the doom’s day. It is a wake-up call for us to amend our ways of living to limit the use of products that contribute to the increase in global warming. For our sake and for existence of all life on our heavenly planet earth, it is the need of the hour that we make sincere efforts and attempts to contain the monster called ‘global warming’"
"A cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital currency that is highly secured by cryptography or encryption techniques which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit such cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is an alternative means of exchange and the transactions of crypto are highly secured using cryptography. Crypto is electronic money or we can say that it is a type of virtual money. The power of governing or controlling the distribution of Cryptocurrency does not lie in the hands of the government or any single authority. It is a decentralized body shared over different networks. Crypto is widely accepted by people all around the globe. These crypto currencies are designed to work as a medium of exchange. Crypto currencies are generally not issued by the government agency of any country. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency networks shields A cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital currency that is highly secured by cryptography or encryption techniques which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit such cryptocurrency. These crypto currencies are designed to work as a medium of exchange. Crypto currencies are generally not issued by the government agency of any country. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency networks shields it from any control of government regulatory bodies on it. Bitcoin is the first type of cryptocurrency that presently remains the most used, valuable, and popular. After bitcoin, many other alternative crypto currencies with varying degrees of functions and specifications have been created. Bitcoin which is the most popular cryptocurrency was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the Satoshi Nakamoto, in the month of April 2021. Through cryptocurrency funds transfer between two parties will be easy and there is no need of third party like credit/debit cards or banks. It can help save money and time for both the remitter and the receiver as it is conducted entirely on the Internet. Cryptocurrency runs on a mechanism that involves very less transaction fees which makes it a cheaper alternative compared to other online transactions. As the payments are encrypted, they are safe and secured and offer an unprecedented level of anonymity. Unlike centralized online transactions, crypto offers a faster and more secure way of transaction over different parts of the world. It does not have the involvement of any third party and hence you need not pay extra charges. Each transaction in crypto is highly secured using the well-known Blockchain technology. In many places, Crypto is not accepted as a legal tender. Since crypto transactions are hidden and there is no governing body, it is impossible to trace the case of fraud. It also does not save your transaction details therefore, the transaction is irreversible that is only one-way. Although, crypto is only for those who have the proper knowledge associated with it. As the cryptocurrency has its own advantages and disadvantages, regulation of cryptocurrency is needed to prevent serious problems to ensure that crypto currencies are not misused, and to protect unsuspecting investors from excessive market volatility and possible scams. However, regulation needs to be clear, transparent, and coherent with a vision that makes investments and transaction in crypto currencies safe. Government should regulate the trading of crypto currencies by including stringent KYC norms, reporting and taxation"
"Today when the world is thriving to use day by day new technology everywhere, Electric Vehicles must be the future means of transport. Pollution, growing demand for fuel, Global Warming, promoting ecofriendly means of transport are some of the reasons for promoting electric vehicles. Electric Vehicles are means of transport that consume eclectic energy as fuel instead of traditional fuels such as petrol, diesel, and CNG. These vehicles may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources or maybe inbuilt with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells, or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. Electric bikes, electric cars, electric rickshaws, etc. are some examples of electric vehicles. Most of the trains including metros are already running worldwide through electricity. An electric vehicle uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. The power of a vehicle electric motor, as in other vehicles, is measured in kilowatts (kW). Usually, direct current (DC) electricity is fed into a DC/AC inverter where it is converted to alternating current (AC) electricity and this AC electricity is connected to a 3-phase AC motor. EVs can be made more or less efficient, polluting and expensive to run, by modifying the electrical generating stations. This would be done by an electrical utility under a government energy policy, in a timescale negotiated between utilities and government. New efficiency and pollution standards rely on the purchase of new vehicles, often as the current vehicles already on the road reach their end-of-life. EVs will take advantage of whatever environmental gains happen when a renewable energy generation station comes online"
"Born into a Jewish family on 14th March 1879 in Germany, Einstein had early speech difficulties, still he was a topper at the elementary school. His father, Hermann Einstein was a salesman and engineer, who with his brother, founded an electrical equipment manufacturing company. Albert had a sister, Maja, two years younger to him. When Albert was five, his father showed him a pocket compass. Albert realized that something in empty space was moving the needle and later stated that this experience made ‘a deep and lasting impression’ on him. In 1889, a family friend named Max Talmud introduced the ten year old Albert to popular science and philosophy texts. These included Kant’s ‘Critique of Pure Reason’ and ‘Euclid’s Elements’. From the latter book, Albert began to understand deductive reasoning, and by the age of 12, he learned Euclidian geometry from a school booklet. In his early teens, Albert attended the new and progressive Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended him to pursue electrical engineering, but Albert clashed with the authorities and resented rote learning. According to him, the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in rote learning. In 1894, when Einstein was fifteen, his father’s business failed and the family moved to Italy. During this time, he wrote his first scientific work, ‘The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields’. Now rather than completing high school, Albert decided to apply directly to the ETH it’s in German language that’s why not written Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. He did not pass. So after completing his secondary school, he got enrolled in the Mathematics programme at full ETH. In 1901, Einstein published a paper in the prestigious ‘Annalen der Physik’ on the capillary forces of a straw. He graduated from ETH with a diploma in teaching. The year 1905 was very fortunate for Einstein. While working in the patent office, he published four papers in the prestigious journal ‘Annalen der Physik’. All the four papers are today recognized as tremendous achievements and hence, 1905 is known as Einstein’s ‘Wonderful year’. These were on photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity and equivalence of matter and energy. He deduced the well-known equation, E = mc square, implying that tiny particles of matter could be converted to huge amounts of energy. This late laid the foundations of nuclear energy. At first, his papers were not taken seriously. But soon they grabbed the attention of Max Planck, who was impressed by them. Max invited Einstein to give lectures at international meetings. In 1906, the patent office promoted Einstein to technical examiner second class, but he did not give up academia. In 1910, he wrote a paper that described the cumulative effect of light scattered by individual molecules in the atmosphere, i.e., why the sky is blue? In 1911, Einstein became an associate professor at the University of Zurich. However, shortly afterwards, he accepted a full professorship at the Charles University of Prague. Here, he published a paper about the effects of gravity on light. This paper appealed the astronomers and they started finding ways of detecting the deflection during a solar eclipse. Einstein completed the theory of relativity in 1915. British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington confirmed his theory during the solar eclipse of 1919. Einstein continued his research works and finally, in 1921, his efforts bore fruits. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the Law of the Photoelectric Effect. Einstein also gave impetus to the science of cosmology. His equations proved that the universe was dynamic, either expanding or contracting. This refuted the opinion of the time that the universe was static. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was actually expanding, as Einstein’s equations had predicted. When Einstein’s popularity grew, he became the target for Nazi Propaganda. They called for physicists to shun Einstein and his Jewish Physics’. He came to know that he was on Nazi hit list when a magazine published his photo with the caption, ‘Not I Yet Hanged’ on its cover. So, in 1932, he left Germany and joined Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey."
"Self-confidence is a state of mind where someone pushes their boundaries and encourages belief from the very beginning, and this comes from a place of selflove. You ought to love yourself to gain that freedom from doubting your actions. Self Confidence is the key to success, or we can say it the first step towards success. If a person possesses self-confidence, then he/she has inevitably won half the battle. We see people in school, workplaces and public sectors who have achieved success be more initiative, more forward and active, and more confident with their decisions, making them stand out from the crowd. But when it comes to a person who cannot trust themselves or believe in themselves, success is a hard gain for them. They become more vulnerable to criticism and failure. They also find it super hard to get back on their feet and carry on. Everyone who has self-confidence gets to enjoy various perks that come along with that state of mind. One of them being is finding the magnitude of a difficult job lesser than it is. It helps you face your failure and own up to it in a positive light. It helps you rise multiple times to believe that you will excel and improve in your next attempt. If you somehow lack this ability, there are high chances of you overcoming with pessimism. Simple jobs and daily chores feel like a challenge in every way. It’s harder for them to take a stand and they are most likely not to be taken seriously. But one why does it make a self-confidence person more persist-able to success - It’s not because they are lucky, or smarter, or because of something external. It’s because self-confident people understand the impact of believing in themselves and relying on their abilities. Though being confident in themselves is one of the best abilities to acquire, but one must also be familiar with the fine line separating self-confidence with overconfidence. Excess of anything is bad, and self-confidence is no exception to that rule. Overconfident people tend not to acknowledge every form of criticism and work on it. People who are experiencing tend to overlook the other side of the coin and embrace themselves now and then, which at some point in time proves harmful. Their narcissism leads them to spiral down in the tunnel of failure. So having moderation helps one attain just the right amount of self-confidence and self-love that will assure them success and satisfaction and happiness that we’d all love to experience from life. The way to gain self-confidence is completely personal and an internal decision, so no speech or essay or conversation will leave a person lacking; it changes all at once. Just like self-love, self-confidence takes time to acquire. But once you start believing in yourself, no one can stop you from conquering all the heights in your life and career"
"Now we have devised robots that are much more complicated than any other machines we have ever had. They are complicated enough to do jobs that until now only human beings could do, but that are too simple for the marvellous brains we all have. The robots, even though they are smarter than other machines, are still only capable of very simple tasks - the kind of tasks human beings ought not to waste their time doing. In that case, why not let the robots do it? Why shouldn't human beings do other and better things? After all, whenever there is an important new invention, some jobs are lost. When the automobile came into use, there was a gradual, but steady, loss of jobs that involved horses. There were fewer stables, fewer manufacturers of buggies and wagons, fewer whips, and fewer spurs. On the other hand, think of the jobs the automobile created. Think of all the garages that came into being, all the auto mechanics needed, all the tyre manufacturing, highway building, oil well drilling. Automobiles created hundreds of times as many jobs as they destroyed. That's the way it will be with robots too. Lots of assembly-line jobs will vanish, but think of all the jobs needed to design robots, manufacture their parts, put them together, install them, and keep them in good repair, There will be many times as many jobs coming into being as are destroyed. The jobs that are destroyed will be very dull ones anyway, so dull that even a robot can do them. The jobs that will be created will be interesting ones that will stretch the mind. Of course, there is a catch. We can't just tell a person who has been working on an assembly line for twenty-five years to stop and take a job designing robots instead. It takes a special kind of education to be able to work with robots, and assembly-line worker won't have it. If we are going to have a large changeover in types of jobs, there will have to be a careful programme of retraining and re-education for people with old-style jobs. It will have to be done even if they take rather simple new-style ones. That Will be expensive and hard, but it will have to be done. There are also sure to be people who are too old, or too beaten down by the dull job they had to do all their lives, to be able to take advantage of retraining. Some sort of jobs will have to be found that they can do. Eventually, of course, things will be different. Children going to schools in the future will be educated in ways or using and understanding computers and robots. They will grow up and De able to take the new jobs, and no one will ever consider the old jobs or want them. Everyone will be glad to leave the dull jobs and the dangerous jobs to"
"Switzerland is the most peaceful country in the world. Although always prepared to face any hazard of war, it has never faced any hostile army since the Swiss Confederation was founded in 1815, nor has its army ever fired at anyone in aggression. Switzerland is, therefore, totally free of the ravages of war. No other European country can claim this distinction. Most of Switzerland's 16,000 square mile area is a continuous, rolling lush countryside of pastures, Vineyards and grain farms, except one third of the mountainous and extremely beautiful region. Three quarters of the population lives in small towns and villages which remain exquisitely medieval in their architecture and external appearance. At very short notice, it can convert itself into an army bristling with military defence, i.e. a whole nation in arms. People of Switzer- land can boast that they do not have an army, but they themselves are an army. The unique aspect of the military preparedness of Switzerland is its constant readiness for facing a nuclear attack or the consequences of a nuclear war in its neighbourhood. Dr. Morgellier, the Chief military spokesman told sometime back that .80% of the population of Switzerland can be moved into under-ground shelters within a few hours. Every aspect of the life of the citizens is tightly supervised by the local police. As a consequence, there is 100% compliance with three specific instructions: one is that every household must keep a reserve stock of approximately two months requirements of food and daily provisions. Secondly, the entire male population must take part in civil defence exercises and must be constantly available for military duty. Thirdly, everyone must be ready at all times with one's arms. The government issue arms and ammunition to each household. All men between 20 and 50 years of age must do military service and until the age of 32, must attend military colleges for 20 days every year and one at least for 90 days. The result is that although Switzerland's regular or standing army is only 65,000 strong, it can put 10 per cent of the population or 650,000 men in the field within 48 hours and all the rest in a few days more. Thus, Switzerland's concern with defence is such that outside observers describe it as an obsession."
"The sun has a family of other planets which keep circling about it at different distances. The earth on which we live is one of those planets. There are nine planets and their names in the order of their distance from the sun are: Mercury (the nearest), Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. In addition to these, about 2,000 minor planets, some of them only a few miles in diameter, swarm round the Sun, between Mars and Jupiter. Mereury, the nearest, is about 30 million miles from the sun, less than half the distance of the earth. Naturally, it is much hotter than the earth. It is, therefore, too hot for anybody to live there. Mercury always turns the same face to the sun and its sunny side is about as hot as molten tin. Its cold side is just frozen masses like snow. Mercury is a small planet, only about one-twentieth, the size of the earth. Venus is 67,000,000 miles from the sun and is also distinctly hotter than the earth. It is certainly too hot to support life. Next after Venus, is the earth which revolves about the sun at a distance of 93,000,000 miles. Moon revolves round the earth at a distance of 2,40,000 miles. Moon is a dead world of dry rock and dust and it contains neither air nor water. It is about 1/50 as big and 1/100 as heavy as the earth. It revolves once every 27 days and so we get a new moon about once a month. The moon always keeps the same side facing the earth. The moon, like the planets, is a cold body which is only visible when the sun shines on it and that is why it appears to be in different shapes at different times. When the sun is shining on its farther side, we cannot see it at all and we say there is no moon. When the sunlight creeps gradually round its edge to show first a crescent, then gradually a bigger size. Full moon happens when the sun shines directly on the side of the moon taking the earth."
"Time is gold and time is money, if we utilıze it in a prop way and would not tolerate to waste even a single minute, because lost minutes add up to lost hours, lost hours add up to lost days, 1Ost days add up to lost years and lost years add up to fruitless life or a life in which so much remained undone. Many of us that are to say office clerks, administrators, doctors, teachers, engineers, law- yers, journalists and others are content to drift along, through the day, because they do not prepare a definite schedule of their activities. So, at the end of every day, they find that very little has been achieved. This is how day succeeds day resulting in a life of very little achievement. Likewise, many of us have no fixed time for rising and so often we sleep extra-long and have to race through the morning news- paper, bath, dress, bolt our breakfast and hurry along to the office. Why is this so? Because we have no clear-cut idea of all that we have to do during the day. We chat overlong with a friend who may call and sometimes there are many callers resulting in half com-plated work which is differed to the next day. On the other hand, if we discipline ourselves rigidly and prep area schedule in advance of all our activities for the whole day and ration time in proportion to the importance of different spheres of activity, we can do much more in brief span of 24 hours and thus enjoy a sense of satisfaction and achievement. It is good to draw up a schedule for the next day's activity at night. By doing so, we know when exactly we have to rise next morning and at what pace we have to complete the various items on our schedule. We should set aside a certain amount of time every day for the family, exercise and recreation and for reading and other means of self-improvement. Often there are instructive and interesting talks by experts at some institution, exhibitions, music recitals and other cultural activities which we must not ignore, because these improve our personality. Thus, the secret of success in our life lies in the most scientific and systematic use of time, as far as possible."
"The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. It guarantees not just the right to make free speech, but the right to hear free speech. The internet is one path to free speech in America. In America, there are debates over the cost of internet services. In China, the government is shutting down internet debate, period. The way the Chinese do this is by closing down internet networks. Censors do not allow Chinese access to YouTube and Google among others. The Chinese practice of closing down the internet is not new. In recent weeks it has become worse. Some say the current climate is the result of the lead-up to a key Chinese Communist Party meeting. The 19th Party Congress takes place this fall. For a long time, smart Chinese internet users have gotten around the censors. Most of them use virtual private networks (VPNs). These are ways of getting around the bans on content. The authorities are targeting these tools. For example, they made Apple pull its VPN apps off the shelves in its stores. Amazon has a cloud computing service. It warned its customers to stop hosting the VPN tools on their sites. Some observers call this a 'cat and mouse game.' Last week the censors showed how much power they had. The censors tried a new way of shutting down websites. They went after the tools that many Chinese use. They cut off the country's internet users from the rest of the world. Internet users continue to try to outwit the country's vast online censorship system. For example, some users can still get to foreign VPNs. An expert said, ""It does appear the crackdown is becoming more intense. But the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been."" Some say China is trying to create a great firewall. Can a country that stifles free speech be a great nation?"
"Jhumpa Lahiri's ""The Third and Final Continent,"" is a moving tale of an Indian immigrant. This young man's ambitious character led him to travel abroad. His struggle took him to attend many great learning institutions. His journeys led him to and elderly woman that made quite an impact on him. Her presence in his life was very significant. This story took place in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1969. The city had two major universities that attracted many foreigners. Boston provided an opportunity to those looking for and education and a better way of life. Many viewed Boston as an international city. It became a home for the young man from India. The narrator tells this story in the Third person unlimited omniscient. It seems as though she is telling the story through her own personal experiences. The reader can almost feel her struggle. The young man keeping with old Indian traditions had an arranged marriage. He seemed very casual and not the least bit interested in taking a wife or the commitment that came with marriage. This is an evident man vs. man relationship. For the average Indian-American there is a personal disconnect when it comes to the idea of home. For where is home? It cannot be America, for as Indians we don't always feel accepted; there will always be something about us that makes us different, that sets us apart from the peers we grew up with. And it won't be India for as Americans we have not lived authentically Indian lives. Always juggling apple pies and samosas, we straddle and mix two different cultures, effectively diluting both of them, never having a strong presence in either. The Americans look at you differently because you have brown skin, different customs. The Indians wonder about your outward appearance, an incongruous amalgam of brown skin and an American accent. So where do we belong? Are we always doomed to live in the uncertainty of hyphenated ethnicities? Our immigrant parents hope not and strive to give us a home to call our own, two homes even, whether America or India cares to accept us or not. Yes, as they drag us through the bustling streets of Thrissur or New Delhi from one auntie's house to the next, as they point out the cows and temples along the way, carefully trying to teach us the proper way to speak in their native language, our parents are making every effort to connect us to our heir."
"Whenever I lose my watch, I take my sweet time to get a new one. I savor the freedom from my compulsion to carve my days into minute-size fragments. But my liberty has its limits. Even if I get rid of the clock strapped to my wrist, I cannot escape the one in my head. The human brain keeps time, from the flicker of milliseconds to the languorous unfurling of hours and days and years. It's the product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Keeping track of time is essential for perceiving what's happening around us and responding to it. In order to tell where a voice is coming from, we time how long it takes for the sound to reach both ears. And when we respond to the voice by speaking ourselves, we need precise timing to make ourselves understood. Our muscles in the mouth, tongue, and throat must all twitch in carefully timed choreography. It's just a brief pause that makes the difference between ""Excuse me while I kiss the sky"" and ""Excuse me while I kiss this guy."" Scientists are finding that telling time is also important to animals. At the University of Edinburgh, researchers built fake flowers with sugar inside to reveal how hummingbirds tell time. After hummingbird's drink nectar from real flowers, it takes time for the flowers to replenish their supply. The Scottish researchers refilled some of their fake flowers every 10 minutes and others every 20. Hummingbirds quickly learned just how long they had to wait before coming back to each kind. Scientists at the University of Georgia have discovered that rats do an excellent job of telling time too. They can be conditioned to wait two days after a meal to poke their noses into a trough and be rewarded with food. For 40 years, psychologists thought that humans and animals kept time with a biological version of a stopwatch. Somewhere in the brain, a regular series of pulses was being generated. When the brain needed to time some event, a gate opened and the pulses moved into some kind of counting device. One reason this clock model was so compelling: psychologists could use it to explain how our perception of time changes. Think about how your feeling of time slows down as you see a car crash on the road ahead, how it speeds up when you're wheeling around a dance floor in love. Psychologists argued that these experiences tweaked the pulse generator, speeding up the flow of pulses or slowing it down. But the fact is that the biology of the brain just doesn't work like the clocks we're familiar with. Neurons can do a good job of producing a steady series of pulses. They don't have what it takes to count pulses accurately for seconds or minutes or more. The mistakes we make in telling time also raise doubts about the clock models. If our brains really did work that way, we ought to do a better job of estimating long periods of time than short ones. Any individual pulse from the hypothetical clock would be a little bit slow or fast. Over a short time, the brain would accumulate just a few pulses, and so the error could be significant. The many pulses that pile up over long stretches of time should cancel their errors out. Unfortunately, that's not the case. As we estimate longer stretches of time, the range of errors gets bigger as well."
"When the man first began to think, he asked himself the deepest of all questions–a question which you have undoubtedly asked yourself many times: What is the meaning of Life? What is it all about? Where are we all going? What drives men ever forward to work and worry? And now there's this other big question-a newer question which is beginning to force itself into our notice. One that is not ages old. That has not been with us since man first began to think. It is: Where is Science Taking Us? First, where is science taking us with regard to ethical and spiritual values? We know what it is doing with regard to material things, for material things are its daily business; but what is it doing with regard to non-material things? If the answer were 'nothing at all,' that would be bad enough; but the actual answer is 'less than nothing.' Here science is actually doing less than nothing. Its material teaching has been so over-emphasized that many people are floundering and wondering whether after all man is but a machine animated by forces over which he has no control. Let's concentrate on material things, the things that form the very stronghold of science. Look at the machine, for instance. This is the age of the machine. Machine are everywhere-in the fields, in the factory, in the home, in the street, in the city, in the country, everywhere. To fly, it is not necessary to have wings; there are machines. To swim under the sea, it is not necessary to have gills, there are machines. To kill our fellow men in overwhelming numbers, there are machines. Petrol machines alone provide ten times more power than all human beings in the world. In the busiest countries, each individual has six hundred human slaves in his machines. What are the consequences of this abnormal power? Before the war, it looked as though it might be possible, for the first time in history, to provide food and clothing and shelter fort the teeming population of the world-every man, woman and child. This would have been one of the greatest triumphs of science. And yet, many a time especially during the war we have seen the world crammed full of food and people hungry. For that's the way of science and the machine age. Science produces the goods, it makes the goods, but has no control over the consequences."
"Astronomers, those people who study the starts, tell us that long-long ago the earth and all the planets were part of the sun. The sun was then as it is now a mass of flaming matter, terribly hot. Somehow little bits of the sun got loose and they shot out into the air. But they could not wholly get rid of their father, the sun. It was as if a rope was tied to them and they kept whirling round the sun. This strange force, which I have compared to a rope, is something which attracts little things to great. It is the force which makes things fall by their weight. The earth being the biggest thing near us, attracts everything we have. In this way our earth also shot us from the sun. It must have been very hot. With terrible hot gases and air all around it, but as it was very much smaller than the sun, it started to cool. The sun also is getting less hot but is will take millions of years to cool down. The earth took much less time to cool. When it was hot, of course nothing could live on it-no man or animal or plant or tree. Everything would have been burnt up then. Just as a bit of the sun shot out and became the moon. Many people think that the moon came out and of the great hollow which is now the Pacific Ocean, between America and Japan. So, the earth started to cool. It took a long time over it. Gradually the surface of the earth became cooler although the interior remained very hot. Even how if you go down. Probably if you could go down deep enough inside the earth you would find it red hot. The moon also started to cool and because it was much smaller than even the earth is cooled more quickly than the earth. It looks delightfully cool, dies it not? It is called the ""cold moon"". Perhaps it is full of glaciers and ice fields. When the earth cooled all the water vapour in the air condensed into water and probably came down as rain. It must have rained a tremendous lot then. All this water filled the great hollows in the earth and so the great oceans and seas were formed. As the earth became cooler and the oceans also became cooler, it became possible for living things to exist on the earth's surface or in the sea."
"I used to go to thrift stores with my friends. We'd take the train into Boston, and go to The Garment District, which is this huge vintage clothing warehouse. Everything is arranged by color, and somehow that makes all of the clothes beautiful. It's kind of like if you went through the wardrobe in the Narnia books, only instead of finding Aslan and the White Witch and horrible Eustace, you found this magic clothing world-instead of talking animals, there were feather boas and wedding dresses and bowling shoes, and paisley shirts and Doc Martens and everything hung up on racks so that first you have black dresses, all together, like the world's largest indoor funeral, and then blue dresses-all the blues you can imagine-and then red dresses and so on. Pink-reds and orangey reds and purple-reds and exit-light reds and candy reds. Sometimes I would close my eyes and Natasha and Natalie and Jake would drag me over to a rack and rub a dress against my hand. ""Guess what color this is."" We had this theory that you could learn how to tell, just by feeling, what color something was. For example, if you're sitting on a lawn, you can tell what color green the grass is, with your eyes closed, depending on how silky-rubbery it feels. With clothing, stretchy velvet stuff always feels red when your eyes are closed, even if it's not red. Natasha was always best at guessing colors, but Natasha is also best at cheating at games and not getting caught. One time we were looking through kid's t-shirts and we found a Muppets t-shirt that had belonged to Natalie in third grade. We knew it belonged to her, because it still had her name inside, where her mother had written it in permanent marker, when Natalie went to summer camp. Jake bought it back for her, because he was the only one who had money that weekend. He was the only one who had a job. Maybe you're wondering what a guy like Jake is doing in The Garment District with a bunch of girls. The thing about Jake is that he always has a good time, no matter what he's doing. He likes everything, and he likes everyone, but he likes me best of all. Wherever he is now, I bet he's having a great time and wondering when I'm going to show up. I'm always running late. But he knows that. We had this theory that things have life cycles, the way that people do. The life cycle of wedding dresses and feather boas and t-shirts and shoes and handbags involves the Garment District. If clothes are good, or even if they're bad in an interesting way, the Garment District is where they go when they die. You can tell that they're dead, because of the way that they smell. When you buy them, and wash them, and start wearing them again, and they start to smell like you, that's when they reincarnate. But the point is, if you're looking for a particular thing, you just have to keep looking for it. You have to look hard. Down in the basement at the Garment Factory they sell clothing and beat-up suitcases and teacups by the pound. You can get eight pounds worth of prom dresses-a slinky black dress, a poufy lavender dress, a swirly pink dress, a silvery, starry lame dress so fine you could pass it through a key ring- for eight dollars. I go there every week, hunting for Grandmother Zofia's faery handbag. The faery handbag: It's huge and black and kind of hairy. Even when your eyes are closed, it feels black. As black as black ever gets, like if you touch it, your hand might get stuck in it, like tar or black quicksand or when you stretch out your hand at night, to turn on a light, but all you feel is darkness. Fairies live inside it. I know what that sounds like, but it's true. Grandmother Zofia said it was a family heirloom. She said that it was over two hundred years old. She said that when she died, I had to look after it. Be its guardian. She said that it would be my responsibility. I said that it didn't look that old, and that they didn't have handbag two hundred years ago, but that just made her cross. She said, ""So then tell me, Genevieve, darling, where do you think old ladies used to put their reading glasses and their heart medicine and their knitting needles?"" I know that no one is going to believe any of this. That's okay. If I thought you would, then I couldn't tell you. Promise me that you won't believe a word. That's what Zofia used to say to me when she told me stories. At the funeral, my mother said, half-laughing and half-crying, that her mother was the world's best liar. I think she thought maybe Zofia wasn't really dead. But I went up to Zofia's coffin, and I looked her right in the eyes. They were closed. The funeral parlor had made her up with blue eyeshadow, and blue eyeliner. She looked like she was going to be a news anchor on Fox television, instead of dead. It was creepy and it made me even sadder than I already was. But I didn't let that distract me. ""Okay, Zofia,"" I whispered. ""I know you're dead, but this is important. You know exactly how important this is. Where's the handbag? What did you do with it? How do I find it? What am I supposed to do now?"" Of course, she didn't say a word. She just lay there, this little smile on her face, as if she thought the whole thing-death, blue eyeshadow, Jake, the handbag, faeries, Scrabble, Baldeziwurlekistan, all of it-was a joke. She always did have a weird sense of humor. That's why she and Jake got along so well. I grew up in a house next door to the house where my mother lived when she was a little girl. Her mother, Zofia Swink, my grandmother, babysat me while my mother and father were at work."
"Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief us for delight, is in prolateness and retiring, for ornament is in discourse, and for ability, is in the judgement and disposition of business. For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars. One by one, but the general counsels, and the plots and marshaling of some affairs, come best from those that are learned. To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament is affectation; to make judgement wholly by their rules, is the humour of a scholar. They perfect nature and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants that need pruning by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men condemn studies; simple men admire them; and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested, that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read but not curiously, and some to be read wholly and with diligence and attention. Some books also may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others, but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner sort of books, else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading makes a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. And therefore if a man writes little; he had need have a great memory; if he confers little, he had need have a present wit, and if he reads littles, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth not."
"This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee cantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the musk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real fighting. He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but quite like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end of his restless nose were pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He could fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his war cry as he scuttled through the long grass was: ""Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!"" One day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down a roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and clung to it till he lost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in the hot sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a small boy was saying, ""Here's a dead mongoose. Let's have a funeral."" ""No,"" said his mother, ""let's take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isn't really dead."" They took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they wrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he opened his eyes and sneezed. ""Now,"" said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into the bungalow), ""don't frighten him, and we'll see what he'll do."" It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoose family is ""Run and find out,"" and Rikki-tikki was a true mongoose. He looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched himself, and jumped on the small boy's shoulder. ""Don't be frightened, Teddy,"" said his father. ""That's his way of making friends."" ""Ouch! He's tickling under my chin,"" said Teddy. Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy's collar and neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose. ""Good gracious,"" said Teddy's mother, ""and that's a wild creature! I suppose he's so tame because we've been kind to him."" ""All mongooses are like that,"" said her husband. ""If Teddy doesn't pick him up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he'll run in and out of the house all day long. Let's give him something to eat."" They gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it immensely, and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then he felt better. ""There are more things to find out about in this house,"" he said to himself, ""than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall certainly stay and find out."" He spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned himself in the bath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and burned it on the end of the big man's cigar, for he climbed up in the big man's lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into Teddy's nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion, because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the night, and find out what made it. Teddy's mother and father came in, the last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on the pillow."
"The Airbus A380 is the largest passenger plane that has ever been built. It can carry more passengers and cargo than any other airplane and its designers say that it uses less fuel and make less noise. The A 380 is a giant in the skies. Its wings span about 80 meters and it has a length of 73 meters. When filled with passengers the A 380 weighs over 500 000 kg. It has three decks - two passenger decks and one for cargo. Up to 840 passengers can fly on the plane if all the seats are built in it. Up to now, the biggest plane was the Boeing 747 which could carry 416 passengers. Designers have used special materials to keep the plane light. Plane makers say that the engines are very low in noise - they produce about half the sound of other engines. The A 380 can fly about 13,000 km non-stop. The plane can reach destinations on other continents without refueling. The A 380 is so big that putting it together causes some problems. It is not built in one place. The parts of the plane come from all over Europe and are put together at the Airbus headquarters in southern France. In the early 1990s Airbus started to design a plane that could compete with Boeing's 747. In 2000 the first airlines ordered the new plane and in January 2005 the first Airbus A 380 was finished. The new Airbus made its first commercial flight with Singapore Airlines. It flew from Singapore to Sydney on 25 October 2007. Over 6000 people worked on the project and up to now 14 airlines have already ordered the A 380. There are, however, problems such a big plane may cause. Are airports big enough for the plane to take off and land or can airlines sell enough tickets to fill the plane ? Testing has shown that the A 380 does not need longer runways. But airports may have problems getting people on and off the huge planes. Waiting lines may be very long and passengers could wait for their baggage for some time. Airbus Industries says the A 380 will focus on big airports like London, New York or Hong Kong where many people travel to the same city."
"An atom is the smallest building block of everything that exists. The smallest object you can see under a microscope has more than 10 billion atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atoms, that we call elements. They form the world we live in. Well known elements are hydrogen, oxygen, iron or lead. When two elements get together they form a compound. For example, water has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Atoms all have about the same size, but they have different weights. Plutonium is one of the heaviest atoms, about 200 times heavier than hydrogen, which is the lightest element. Parts of the Atom An atom consists of three parts : protons, neutrons, electrons. Protons and neutrons are in the center of an atom, which is called the nucleus. It is very small if you compare it with the whole atom and it has almost all of an atom's mass. If an atom had a diameter of about 6 km the nucleus would only be as big as a tennis ball. The rest of the atom outside the nucleus is mostly empty. Electrons fly around in an atom very, very quickly. They have almost no mass and travel around the nucleus millions of times every second. The parts of an atom have electrical charges. Each proton carries a positive electrical charge and each electron has a negative electrical charge. Neutrons have no charge. In most cases an atom has the same number of protons and electrons. It is electrically neutral. The energy of the nucleus keeps the electron inside the atom—just like the Earth keeps the moon in its orbit. But electrons have energy themselves. They want to break away from the nucleus. If an electron has a lot of energy it moves around farther away from the nucleus. Electrons move around the nucleus in up to seven round paths, called shells. The first shell is closest to the nucleus. It can hold two electrons. The second shell can hold 8, the third 18 and the fourth 32 electrons. In most atoms, the outer shells are never completely filled with electrons. The inner electrons travel fastest, the outer ones are the slowest. The atomic number tells you how many protons an atom has. For example, every hydrogen atom has the atomic number 1 because it only has 1 proton. Elements that have atomic numbers of up to 92 can be found in nature; those over 92 are created by scientists in a laboratory. The atomic number tells us where we can find an element in the periodic table. This table shows all the atoms in groups. The atomic mass is the number of portions and neutrons in an atom. Although all atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, they sometimes have more neutrons. Such atoms are called isotopes. For example, hydrogen has three isotopes. Most of the time a hydrogen atom has one proton and one neutron. Sometimes you can find hydrogen isotopes that have two or three neutrons, but they too have only one proton. In most lighter elements the nucleus of each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. but heavier elements have more neutrons than protons. Uranium, for example has 92 protons and 146 neutrons. It's atomic mass is 238. The atomic mass is never a whole number, because scientists do not just add protons and neutrons together. They use a complicated formula. Normally, an atom is electrically neutral. But it can gain or lose electrons when it crashes with other atoms. Atoms that gain or lose electrons are called ions. They have an electric charge. Atoms that lose electrons become positive ions; atoms that win electrons become negative ions. In some atoms the nucleus can change naturally. Such an atom is radioactive. When a nucleus changes it produces rays. In nature, there are some elements that are radioactive, like uranium or radium. In labs scientists can produce radioactivity by bombarding atoms with smaller particles. In the 1930s and 40s scientists found out that if they bombarded a uranium atom with a neutron the nucleus would split up into two parts. When this happens energy is set free. We call this nuclear fission. Fission was first used in atomic bombs that the Americans dropped over Japan to end the Second World War. The bombs released so much energy that they killed hundreds of thousands of people. Later on scientists found out how this energy could be used in a peaceful way. In the 1950s the first atomic reactors were built. They produced energy by splitting atoms. Compounds are groups of two or more elements that are tied together. They are created when two different atoms share the same electron or when electrons travel from one atom to another. SaltEvery compound has certain features and a chemical formula. Water, for example, is a compound that has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in it. Its chemical formula is H 2O. When sodium (Na) combines with chlorine (Cl) you get a compound called salt (NaCl). Carbon and hydrogen atoms form methane, or natural gas (CH 4). Compounds can be divided into two groups: organic compounds always have carbon atoms in them. You can find them in all living creatures, in plants and in a lot of our food, for example sugar and fat. All other compounds are called inorganic compounds. Compounds can be solids, liquids or gases. They may also turn into many different colours. Some compounds react very quickly, others don't react at all."
"When Charles Darwin was born in 1809 science was still in its baby shoes. Chemists were talking about atoms, physicists about energy and electricity. Nobody really knew what it was. By the time he died in 1882 scientists were able to explain light and electromagnetic waves. And, thanks to Darwin, biologists were able to explain how life on Earth developed. Darwin was the best biologist of all times. He was an expert on plants, animals and insects. But he didn't want to be a biologist at first. At school and the university Darwin was just an average student. He read a lot and collected beetles and butterflies. He went to Edinburgh to study medicine but soon found out that it wasn't the right thing for him. At Cambridge he met a fellow botanist, John Steven Henslow. Henslow helped him get a job on the exploration ship Beagle. The ship travelled around the world for five years and Darwin learned a lot about the forms of life. When Darwin returned to England he was a well-known scientist who lived an isolated life in the countryside where he did experiments and studied plants and animals. Darwin read a lot of interesting books. One of them influenced him a great deal. A popular economist claimed that when the population grew the people would need more and more food. But there was not enough for everybody, so food would become scarce and not everyone could survive and have children. Darwin thought that this had to be true for animals and plants as well. Those that had food would survive and the others would die. Charles Darwin-Father of EvolutionThis helped Darwin solve many questions of life. While many scientists thought that all animals and plants had always been the same Darwin wasn't sure about this. During his voyage on the Beagle he began to think about it. He explored places where he saw that many"
"After being in exile for 50 years the question is becoming more and more important among Tibetans. Will the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, ever return to his home country? The Chinese authorities are expecting protests throughout Tibet and have sent police and army units into the region. The government has also forbidden foreigners to enter the region. In the meantime the 74-year old Dalai Lama does not expect to return to Tibet anytime soon. He admits that he has not succeeded in getting Beijing to give the region more rights. The Tibetan leader accuses the Chinese government of committing cultural genocide and fears that Tibet's ancient culture may disappear forever. On the other hand the Beijing government has claimed that since the Dalai Lama was overthrown and left the country 50 years ago Tibet has become a more modern society. The Dalai Lama still hopes to return to Tibet one day. When that day comes he has promised to return his power to create a local government under Chinese rule. At the same time he is afraid that his return from exile may lead to more anti-Chinese feelings and discontent may spread. In Tibet the Dalai Lama is the central figure around which everything revolves. Many Tibetans want him back, even if it means more trouble with the Chinese. However, there may not be very much time left. The Dalai Lama is getting older and his health is not always at its best. Last year he spent many weeks in an Indian hospital. He has also called off meetings, lectures and trips to other countries. Political experts think that Beijing is not really looking for a solution to the issue, but simply waiting for the Dalai Lama to die. His successor would not be as popular as he is. The Chinese, however, are aware that they shouldn't provoke the people as they stand behind their Dalai Lama."
"Fish are animals that live in water. They are vertebrates, animals with backbones, and come in all kinds of shapes, sizes and colors. Fish first appeared in the oceans of the Earth about 500 million years ago, long before dinosaurs roamed our planet. Today there are tens of thousands of different kinds of fish and new species are discovered every year. Over millions of years fish have changed their features and adapted to their surroundings in order to survive. The whale shark is the largest fish on Earth. It can grow up to 12 meters in length and can weigh up to 15 tons. In contrast tiny gobies are often only a few mm long. Fish are important to people. They were among the first animals hunted by primitive human beings. Millions of people all over the world depend on fish as a main form of nutrition. In many coastal countries, for example Japan or Norway, people depend on fishing to make a living. Fish are a part of the food chain. They eat animals and are eaten by other sea creatures, thus keeping up the balance of nature. Fish live all over the world, in the cold water of the Arctic as well as in warm tropical water around the equator. Areas rich in fish are especially around the coastal shelves of the Northern Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and the western Pacific Ocean. Most of the world's fish live in salt water. They preferably live in areas where warm and cold currents meet. Some types live in the warm tropical waters around coral reefs. About 40% of all fish species are in fresh water. They include carp, catfish, trout or bass. Some of them live in the clear water of rivers while others prefer muddy pond water. A few types of fish can swim in both salt and fresh water. Salmon, for example, are born in fresh water, migrate"
"The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the largest and most famous suspension bridges in the world. It spans the entrance of San Francisco Bay connecting Northern California to San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge has become one of the most famous landmarks in the world The bridge has vast dimensions. It is 2,700 meters long and consists of over 75,000 tons of steel and 300,000 cubic meters of concrete. There are two towers on both sides of the bridge that hold up steel cables almost one meter in diameter. These two support towers span over 1200 meters. The bridge reaches a height of about 260 meters above the surface of the water. A six-lane road and two sidewalks make the Golden Gate Bridge an important traffic connection between San Francisco and Marin City in the north. About 100,000 cars cross the bridge every day. Before the Golden Gate Bridge was built ferries had taken people from one side of San Francisco Bay to the other. The bridge was planned in 1916 by the Joseph Strauss, an engineer and designer. Construction began in 1933 and it was finished in 1937. The whole project cost 35 million dollars. At the time of construction many people did not think that such a bridge could be built. Problems had to be overcome. First, the new bridge was near the San Andreas Fault, an earthquake line that divides California into two parts. After an earthquake had hit the region about a hundred kilometers south of San Francisco, authorities started plans to refit the structures of the bridge to make it withstand quakes that may hit the centre of San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge can also be a tragic place. More people commit suicide jumping off the bridge than at any other place in the world. Over thirty people jump to death every year. In its 75-year history the bridge has only been closed"
"The fact that its span takes us over one of the most tumultuous time in the history of world and India makes it even more stirring. Well done Akshay Kumar and Reema Kagti for choosing the right subject and delivering a crackling film. And then, extra marks to Akshay for delivering an engrossing performance. While walking into the theatre, I had misgivings about Akshay playing a Bengali but he has managed the act with finesse. He is also secure in his space and lets others shine. Akshay is not the hockey captain, the coach or the manager; he is just a man with a dream. During the most important moments of the film, he is either outvoted or left behind. As the superstar in the film, he leads but gives space to others wherever needed. That perhaps is the biggest achievement of Gold-it fleshes out its characters, giving everybody a space to breathe. Thanks to Akshay sharing the spotlight, an ensemble cast can rise and shine. There's Kunal Kapoor's erstwhile hockey captain and Vineet Singh's Muslim vice-captain and a freedom fighter. However, the team's dynamics and its inner push-and-pull are presented through the competition between Raghubir Pratap Singh (Amit Sadh) and Himmat Singh (Sunny Kaushal). Different in circumstances and demeanours, they give us a major Chak De! Deja vu during Gold. Mouni Roy as Akshay's wife Monobina is just the right mixture of crotchety and charming. With her grasp of Bengali, she brings that extra something to the film's milieu. Akshay and Mouni's scenes together are the spice that Gold needed; she takes down her husband a notch or two every time they are together. Patriotism is also weaved in nicely given it is the Independence Day release and is a sports drama that has a country avenging decades of slavery. You know who is going to win, you know what is going to happen in the middle and you know National Anthem will play before it is over, but it is August 15 and you're prepared. More than manipulation, it is the predictability that can become bit of a drag at certain places. For instance, if there are two centre forwards vying to be the star of the team, you know there will be a male appropriation of the 'Komal, dikha de us launde ko' moment. There are many such scenes in the film that feel obvious but such is the tenor of the film that you bob along. Overall, Gold is a well plotted drama that sometimes devolves into schmaltz and melodrama. However, it gives us solid two-and-half hours of tricolour hued entertainment. We suggest XL sized popcorn tubs."
"Whether you're a gym rat or someone who's just started working out in a gym, there are some rules that one must follow. And these rules are never put up on a soft board, but are understood. No one likes that guy who puts down his towel on a machine, only to use it after an hour. So, if you want to earn a few brownie points among your gym pals, we suggest you read further. These unwritten rules around hygiene, cleanliness, common courtesy are often ignored, but it's important to follow them. Always, always put the equipment back from where you picked up. Whether it is weight, foam rollers, yoga mats make sure you keep it back from where you found it. This will not only save time for the person who wants to work out after you, but will also keep the work out area orderly. If you're working out on a machine, make sure to wipe it down once you're done. Nothing is grosser that having to clean someone else's sweat. Don't blast your techno music, the person working out next to you may prefer metal. Always carry your headphones to listen to your favourite music, podcast or watch your bookmarked shows. It's ok if you wish to step away from the machine for a couple of minutes, but don't keep a towel on a machine to reserve it if you're only going to be back after more than 10 minutes. Let someone else use it while you're busy. We agree that lifting heavy weights can involve some amount of shouting, but avoid unnecessary yelling as it may be intimidating to some. And it can also be irritating. The gym is where you come to work out, so avoid making or taking long calls. If you really need to speak, then just step out. By the way, this rule applies to all kinds of spaces, especially open"
